		<h2>About me</h2>
		<h4> My interest in coding started in high school, however due to circumstances I was not able to start learning
			until around 2019, when I started to learn and apply myself to different projects. I quickly learned that it
			can take a long time to perfect even the basic skills. However that did not stop me, and I continued to
			learn and improve what I already knew which has allowed me to take on even bigger and more complex projects
			as time went on. I enjoy looking at a code I wrote and see that it works, after I spend hours figuring out
			how to make it work. There is really something satisfying in it.</h4>
		<h4>My plan for now is to continue to improve and learn more about different frameworks, however in a long
			run I would like to switch to a programing language and code games or simulations, as I really enjoy
			watching my code come to life.</h4>
